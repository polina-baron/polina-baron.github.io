**Abstract.** The *moduli space of translation surfaces* carries an action of \( \mathrm{SL}_2\mathbb{R} \) that is central to understanding dynamics on individual surfaces. We generalize this to actions on *products of translation surfaces* by a subgroup \( G \le \prod_{i=1}^n \mathrm{SL}_2\mathbb{R} \). Using *variations of Hodge structure*, we show that invariant subbundles for the \(G\)-action respect the Hodge structure, yielding semisimplicity results. Our key result is a *joint polynomiality theorem*: for any affine invariant manifold \( \mathcal{M} \) inside a product of strata, the \(G\)-equivariant orthogonal projector onto a flat invariant subbundle (and its tensors) has, in period/affine coordinates \( (x,y) \), entries rational in \( (x,y) \) with a fixed quadratic denominator \( A(x,y) \); equivalently, the entries are homogeneous of degree \(0\) in \(x,y,1/A\).
