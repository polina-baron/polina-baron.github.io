   In his paper “The Mumford dynamical system and hyperelliptic Kleinian functions” (*Funct. Anal. & Its Appl.* 57:4, 27–45, 2023), Victor Buchstaber developed the differential-algebraic theory of the Mumford dynamical system. The key object of this theory is the (P,Q)-recursion introduced in that paper. In the present work, we further develop the theory of the (P,Q)-recursion and describe its connections to the Korteweg–de Vries (KdV) hierarchy, the Lenard operator, and the Gelfand–Dikii recursion.

**Abstract.** In his paper “The Mumford dynamical system and hyperelliptic Kleinian functions” (*Funct. Anal. & Its Appl.* 57:4, 27–45, 2023), Victor Buchstaber developed the differential-algebraic theory of the Mumford dynamical system. The key object of this theory is the \((P,Q)\)-recursion introduced in that paper. In the present work, we further develop the theory of the \((P,Q)\)-recursion and describe its connections to the Korteweg–de Vries (KdV) hierarchy, the Lenard operator, and the Gelfand–Dikii recursion.
