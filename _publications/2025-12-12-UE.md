    We present a new construction on translation surfaces called the <i>branched slit-induced \(n\)-cover</i>: on a uniquely ergodic \(X\), pick a slit \(s=[P,Q]\); take \(n\) copies and switch sheets \(i \mapsto i+1 \pmod n\) each time the vertical flow hits \(s\) (i.e., glue the copies together). Unique ergodicity is shown to be robust for such covers under fairly weak constraints. Moreover, the conditions are mostly geometric despite the measure-theoretic core of the problemâ€”particularly notable because the varied parameter here is not the flow direction (as is standard in the field) but the new surface construction itself. <i>Joint with E.~Shuvaeva.</i>

**Abstract.** We present a new construction on translation surfaces called the *branched slit-induced \(n\)-cover*: on a uniquely ergodic \(X\), pick a slit \(s=[P,Q]\); take \(n\) copies and switch sheets \(i \mapsto i+1 \pmod n\) each time the vertical flow hits \(s\) (i.e., glue the copies together). It turns out that the unique-ergodicity property is robust for such covers under fairly weak constraints. Moreover, the conditions are mostly geometric despite the measure-theoretic core of the problem. This is especially notable because the setup is starkly different from the standard one in this area, where the varied parameter is not the flow direction but the surface construction itself. *Joint with E.~Shuvaeva.*
