**Math PhD Candidate, University of Chicago.**  
Hello! My name is Polina Baron. I am a graduate student at the Department of Mathematics at the University of Chicago, projected to graduate in Spring 2026. I enjoy the honour of working with Professor Simion Filip. Before that, I did my Bachelour degree in Mathematics at HSE (Moscow, Russia; 2016-2020), where I was lucky to work under the guidance of Professor Alexandra (Sasha) Skripchenko. I am currently interested in Dynamical Systems and their applications. I study Teichmüller dynamics, translation (flat) surfaces, and ergodic theory. I also have side project in Integrable Systems (KdV hierarchy). I am on the job market for the year 2026.

In my free time, I enjoy crocheting and swimming.
